## DATA
The datasets used in this project cover the daily data between year 2000 – 2020 for San Francisco Air quality data are  collected at outdoor monitors across the United States and can be download from EPA (Environment ProtectionAgency) web site https://www3.epa.gov/airdata/ad_data.html.


The datasets used in this project cover the daily data between year 2013 – 2017 for Beijing. Air quality data are  collected at outdoor monitors across the Beijin and can be download from UCI (UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository) web site https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data

The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. Smaller AQI means better air quality.

EPA calculates the AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act:

Ozone
PM (Particle pollution or particulate matter)
CO (carbon monoxide)
SO2 (sulfur dioxide)
NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)
Therefore, in our data and visualiztion analysis, we will only be seeing the AQI of these pollutants. See Figure 1 for example of the data. And the Overall AQI is the maximum AQI among these pollutants (Overall AQI = max(Ozone, PM10, PM25, CO, SO2, NO2) ). Note that PM2.5 are not being monitored until late 1990's. Therefore there will be some missingness for PM25 variable.

EPA has divided AQI into six categories, which represent the level of air quality conditions. See Figure 2 below for the AQI ranges and corresponding air quality conditions.

## Summary
My results imply the following:

3.

As air quality has been improved and there are still pollutants (Ozone, NO2, and PM2.5) retain at high AQI. Effort should continuously be made to reduce them. How can we make a difference? Drive less, use less electricity, don't burn wood or trash, support measures in your community that can cut air pollution, etc.

Also air quality continues to worsen in cities across the world, especially in low-income countries and developing countries.  Cooperation should be setup among countries in combating air pollution.
